# Message Encoder & Decoder

This repository contains my Python programs that encode and decode messages using ASCII conversions and number base transformations.  
The project was inspired by my first-year coursework in **Introduction to Algorithms & Programming** at Wits University.  

## 🔑 Features
- **Task 1:** Convert text into ASCII values.
- **Task 2:** Convert ASCII values back into text.
- **Task 3:** Convert decimal numbers into a given base (2–36).
- **Task 4:** Convert numbers in a given base back into decimal.
- **Task 5:** Complete system for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## 🚀 How It Works
- **Encryption:** Each character is converted to ASCII, then represented in the chosen base.  
- **Decryption:** Base-b numbers are converted back to decimal and then to ASCII characters.  

This simulates a simple text encryption and decryption process.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Concepts Used:** loops, conditionals, string manipulation, ASCII, number systems, modular arithmetic

## 📚 Learning Outcome
Through this project I practiced:
- Writing clean, modular Python code
- Implementing base conversions (decimal ↔ base-b)
- Combining smaller tasks into a full system (Task 5)
